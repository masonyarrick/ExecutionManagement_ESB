    "description" : "In the DM App Service, the DM ESB (Contract) API uses the defined operations event message, workDefined, to notify subscribing L2-L4 app services or applications when an instance of the following objects are defined: work masters, resource relationship networks, workflow specifications, resource instances and definitions (material, equipment, and personnel, test specifications, work alerts, and work records.  The DM function services production and support operations by managing all Level 3 and some Level 2 information definition. The primary work definition object is the work master which is the requirements for all work task in mining supply chain operations.  The work master contains the required bill of resources, the workflow specification for execution, and parameter specifications. The work master includes    1) Material specification object with material use for production operations as material produced, consumable, material consumed, by-product produced, co-product produced, and yield produced. The material specification is typically represents the manufacturing bill of materials (BoM).    2) Required equipment specifications and personnel specifications. The resource specifications define the applied resource definition or class objects.    3) Workflow specification object defines a workflow as a collection of nodes and connections with the rules for relationship and dependency. A node may reference a chilld work master for more detail. The workflow specification can reference a master recipe (ANSI/ISA-88.00.01 and IEC 61512-1 definitions), standard operating procedure (SOP), standard operating conditions (SOC), routing, or assembly steps based on the production strategy used.      4) parameter specification object defines the job order specific parameters and rule sets which instructs how L3 manufacturing operations and L2 process sequences how to execute production or supporting operations.     Each work master (ISA-95 Part 4) has a defined scope to an equipment heirachy level as either general, site, work cell, unit or lower.  The DM specifications are sent and applied by other Level 3 functions and Level 2 functions. DM Administration includes management of the distribution of DM specifications to systems across L2-L4. Some of the product production rule sets as equipment and process production rule sets may exist in Level 2 controllers and devices. When that is the case, exchanges of this L2 information shall be coordinated with production execution management and data collection management activities DM information is used by production execution management function to provide operational commands to L2 equipment controllers and devices; the operational commands provides as the workflow specification is executed per the job order.",
